## 🎯 Business Problem  

- Identify low-performing vendors negatively affecting profit margins  
- Understand product-level profitability and freight cost impact  
- Detect operational inefficiencies in procurement and supplier deliveries  
- Predict future vendor risk using historical performance  
- Segment vendors for targeted negotiation and engagement strategies

## 🛠️ End-to-End Workflow  

### 1. 📦 Data Collection  
Collected supplier, sales, freight, and product data to simulate a multi-vendor environment.

### 2. 🔄 Data Ingestion Pipeline  
- **Tech**: Apache Airflow (Dockerized), Astro Cloud  
- **Task**: Load raw CSVs into PostgreSQL database via automated DAGs  

### 3. 📊 EDA with SQL  
- Performed deep analysis using SQL queries directly on PostgreSQL  
- Uncovered cost anomalies, freight issues, vendor delivery patterns  

### 4. ⚙️ ETL Pipeline  
- Built modular ETL using Apache Airflow DAGs  
- Tasks include: data cleaning, standardization, enrichment, KPI derivation  

### 5. 📈 Performance Analysis (Python)  
- Tools: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  
- Visual analysis of profit margins, freight cost vs. sales, vendor ranking  

### 6. 🤖 ML Integration  
- **Models Used**:  
  - *Logistic Regression* for Vendor Profitability Classification  
  - *K-Means Clustering* for Vendor Segmentation  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Web App for stakeholder interaction
